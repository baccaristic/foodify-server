# Architecture Migration Recap

This document summarises the architecture-level outcomes of the Foodify migration roadmap executed across phases 1–12. It highlights how the monolith evolved towards a microservice-ready platform and the operational benefits unlocked along the way.

## 1. Hardened Domain Boundaries
- Replaced cross-module repository usage with directory/catalog services inside Identity, Restaurants, and Addresses.
- Orders now depends on stable interfaces owned by each bounded context, paving the way for future service extraction without leaking persistence details.
- Validation and not-found handling live within the owning module, clarifying responsibility boundaries and easing contract publication.

**Benefit:** The monolith behaves as a constellation of modular domains, reducing coupling and lowering the risk of regression when the services are carved out.

## 2. Platform Foundations for Cloud Native Runtime
- Added Spring Cloud Config, Eureka client, load-balanced HTTP clients, and gateway-friendly settings guarded by feature flags.
- Introduced OpenTelemetry auto-configuration and Micrometer observations to emit consistent metrics and traces once collectors are available.

**Benefit:** The application can register with discovery, source shared configuration, and emit telemetry without code changes, making the eventual split into independently deployed services smoother.

## 3. Event-Driven Order Lifecycle
- Standardised the order lifecycle message contract, capturing order, payment, client, restaurant, and logistics snapshots.
- Lifecycle events are emitted via dedicated publishers that can route to Kafka or remain no-ops based on configuration.

**Benefit:** Downstream services (pricing, logistics, notifications) can subscribe to rich, versioned events instead of polling the monolith, aligning with the CQRS/Saga strategy.

## 4. Reliable Messaging via Outbox Pattern
- Persisted lifecycle messages in a transactional outbox with retry, backoff, and telemetry instrumentation.
- Added startup backfill workflows to seed historical events, ensuring zero data loss before turning on the dispatcher.

**Benefit:** Guarantees at-least-once delivery without distributed transactions, simplifying the transition to asynchronous integrations and enabling auditability of lifecycle changes.

## 5. Redis-Powered Read Model & Tracking API
- Projected lifecycle events into a Redis-backed order tracking view with configurable TTLs.
- Exposed a dedicated `/api/orders/{orderId}/tracking` endpoint that surfaces cached order, courier, and status details, returning `501` when the feature toggle is disabled.

**Benefit:** Demonstrates the CQRS read model pattern, offering low-latency tracking responses and a clear blueprint for future read-heavy workloads.

## 6. Operational Guardrails & Observability
- Wrapped the outbox processor and Kafka listeners with Micrometer counters and tracing spans.
- Centralised feature toggles (`APP_ORDERS_*`, `SPRING_CLOUD_DISCOVERY_ENABLED`, etc.) to make optional integrations safe in local and CI environments.

**Benefit:** Engineers can enable advanced capabilities incrementally while retaining visibility into success/failure rates, reducing operational surprises during rollout.

## 7. Deployment & Developer Experience Enhancements
- Added Docker Compose profiles for Kafka, Redis, Eureka, and OTLP collector plus Kubernetes manifests that set the required flags.
- Documented end-to-end workflows for bootstrapping infrastructure, running backfills, validating projections, and interacting through Swagger.

**Benefit:** Onboarding and testing cycles are faster—developers can reproduce the emerging distributed topology locally and follow repeatable validation steps before promoting to higher environments.

## 8. Identity Service Strangler & OIDC Alignment
- Centralised all authentication flows behind the `IdentityAuthService` facade, moving phone signup persistence and token minting away from controllers.
- Added an opt-in remote mode that proxies to the new `services/identity-service` Spring Boot app, which mirrors the contracts exposed by the monolith.
- Issued OIDC-compliant tokens that surface `tokenType`, `expiresIn`, and `scope` metadata, and added contract tests to lock the wire format for BFFs and edge gateways.

**Benefit:** Identity becomes an independently deployable component with standards-based tokens, enabling staged strangler rollouts and tighter compatibility guarantees for clients.

## 9. Catalog Service Facade & Remote Microservice
- Wrapped restaurant and menu lookups behind `RestaurantCatalogService`, with conditional wiring for local repository access or a remote `RestClient` proxy.
- Published a standalone catalog Spring Boot service (under `services/catalog-service`) exposing REST endpoints for restaurants, menu items, and extras, packaged for Docker Compose alongside the platform stack.
- Added remote contract tests so order flows continue to validate menu data even when the catalog service is the source of truth.

**Benefit:** Order placement and pricing can consume catalog data without touching persistence directly, paving the way to split the catalog domain into an independently scaled service while safeguarding existing flows.

---

Collectively, these changes transition the monolith from a tightly coupled application into a modular, event-aware platform that already exercises the patterns required for a federated microservice architecture. Services can now be extracted incrementally with confidence that data contracts, messaging reliability, observability, and deployment ergonomics have been addressed.

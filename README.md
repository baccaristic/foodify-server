# Foodify Server

## Swagger / OpenAPI Playground

This project now exposes interactive API documentation powered by [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) through Springdoc OpenAPI.

### How to run locally
1. Start the infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis) via Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   The app expects a PostgreSQL database named `foodify` with the username and password `foodify`. These defaults can be overridden through the `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, and `DATABASE_PASSWORD` environment variables.
2. Install dependencies and start the application:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```
3. Once the server is running, open your browser at [http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html).

### Authenticating requests in Swagger UI
Many endpoints require a JWT access token. You can obtain a token by calling one of the authentication endpoints (for example `POST /api/auth/login`) with valid credentials. After retrieving the `accessToken` from the response:

1. Open the Swagger UI page and press the **Authorize** button in the top-right corner.
2. Select the `bearerAuth` scheme and enter the token in the field using the format:
   ```
   Bearer <your-jwt-token>
   ```
3. Click **Authorize** and then **Close**. All subsequent requests sent from Swagger UI will include the JWT in the `Authorization` header, allowing you to exercise protected endpoints.

### Notes
- The OpenAPI specification is available at `/v3/api-docs` (JSON) or `/v3/api-docs.yaml` (YAML).
- Swagger UI and the OpenAPI documents are publicly accessible while the rest of the API remains protected by the existing security configuration.

## Client nearby restaurant APIs

The consolidated `/api/client/nearby` endpoint has been split into focused endpoints so clients can
load targeted sections independently:

- `GET /api/client/nearby/top` – returns the five closest restaurants ranked by overall score.
- `GET /api/client/nearby/favorites` – returns up to five nearby restaurants drawn from the client’s
  saved favorites.
- `GET /api/client/nearby/orders` – returns nearby restaurants the client has ordered from most
  recently ("order again").
- `GET /api/client/nearby/restaurants` – returns the complete nearby restaurant listing with
  pagination support.

Each response reuses `RestaurantDisplayDto` and includes delivery-fee and favorite flags so the
mobile app can render consistent cards across the different sections.

### Setting environment variables with Docker Compose

Docker Compose automatically reads a `.env` file that lives next to `docker-compose.yml`. Populate it with any overrides you need before starting the stack:

```env
KONNECT_SANDBOX_API_KEY=your-sandbox-key
KONNECT_SANDBOX_WALLET_ID=wallet-id
KONNECT_SANDBOX_WEBHOOK_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8081/api/payments/konnect/webhook
```

Alternatively, pass a different env file when booting the services:

```bash
docker compose --env-file ops/dev.env up -d
```

You can also export variables in your shell (`export DATABASE_URL=...`) before running `docker compose up`. Compose propagates those values into each service's `environment` block, including the application container.
